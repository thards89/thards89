:earth_americas:<b>Where is the Rock Bar Full Stack Website</b> :earth_americas:<br>
Website created with the idea that came with my classmates of creating an app that helps expats to look for places really
close to their homes and create a blog to report their experiences. <br>
I used the base of that project to create this new website where you can find Rock Bars close by you and also register your experience on them. The default range distance is 5km.
